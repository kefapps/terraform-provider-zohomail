# zohomail Provider

The `zohomail` provider manages Zoho Mail administration objects under the public source address `kefapps/zohomail`.

The current v1 surface focuses on mailbox and domain administration:

- mailbox creation
- mailbox aliases and internal forwarding
- domain creation and onboarding
- domain aliases
- DKIM
- catch-all
- subdomain stripping

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zohomail = {
      source = "kefapps/zohomail"
    }
  }
}

provider "zohomail" {
  organization_id = var.zohomail_organization_id
  access_token    = var.zohomail_access_token
  data_center     = var.zohomail_data_center
}
```

## Environment Variables

- `ZOHOMAIL_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `ZOHOMAIL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `ZOHOMAIL_DATA_CENTER`

## Notes

- `zohomail_mailbox_alias` is the primary v1 answer for routing several addresses from the same domain to one mailbox.
- `zohomail_mailbox_forwarding` is intentionally limited to domains already attached to the mailbox and does not automate external verification workflows.
